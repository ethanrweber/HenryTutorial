SKILLS
--- these ideas come from watching the show and from reading the MIA fandom wiki page for Reg ---
- Passive:
	- Super Durability:
		"Reg's body is extremely durable. <description of skill>"
		- idea 1: 
			- take x % less damage from every hit
		- idea 2:
			- gain x % more base healing from every healing source
	- Recharge:
		- idea 1:
			- gain an additional charge of Incinerator on taking x amount of electricity damage, or when lightning strikes nearby (overloading enemies, royal capacitor, etc)
		- idea 2: 
			- gain an additional charge of Incinerator on activating the teleporter
		- mixed idea:

- Primary:
	- Punch:
- Secondary:
	- Extendable arms:
- Utility:
	- ?
- Special:
	- Incinerator:
		- very strong laser attack, pierces through all enemies in line of sight for an unlimited distance
		- hold down button to charge up for increased damage and width of beam
			- limit max width based on a time limit for holding down the button
			- maybe increase max time/width limit with Backup Magazine?	
		- average cooldown, but limited number of uses per stage (similar to Captain's orbital supply beacon)
			- in addition, consider an alternate Passive ability
